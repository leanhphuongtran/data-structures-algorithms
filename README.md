# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains my practice solutions and learning notes for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).  
I'm solving problems in both **Python** and **C#**, and learning from multiple sources like courses, books, and tutorials.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- ✅ Linear Search
- ✅ Binary Search
- 🔜 Recursion (Trees, Graphs, Backtracking, DP & more)
- 🔜 DFS and BFS
- 🔜 Sliding window
- 🔜 Sorting
- 🔜 Arrays
- 🔜 Linked Lists
- 🔜 HashMaps
- 🔜 Stacks
- 🔜 Queues
- 🔜 Trees
- 🔜 Graphs
- 🔜 Heaps
- 🔜 Strings
- 🔜 Sets

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each topic has its own folder:

## 📚 Sources I'm Learning From

- Jovian DSA Course (Python)
- FreeCodeCamp (C# Algorithms)
- Codecademy (C# Algorithms)
- LeetCode & HackerRank problems
- YouTube (NeetCode, Tech with Tim, etc.)

I'll keep adding more as I learn!
